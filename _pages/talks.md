<b>Séminaire des Doctorants</b> - Introduction to newcomers <br>
<i>Title</i>. Modeling, solving & implementing PDEs from waves-structure interactions. <br>
<i>Date</i>. 25/10/23.

<i>Abstract</i>. We talk first about the benefits of using Shallow-Water models to describe nearshore hydrodynamics, but also the challenges since we deal with hyperbolic equations. We then introduce briefly Finite-Volume, Discontinuous Galerkin methods and a novel approach by François Vilar combining these methods. We finally talk about the interests of working on hyperbolic wave-structures interactions, since our research offers insights valuable for renewable energy development.
