I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics, under the supervision of [François Vilar](https://vilar.perso.math.cnrs.fr) & [Fabien Marche](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~marche/) at [Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck](https://imag.umontpellier.fr) (IMAG - UMR 5149).

I'm also a teaching assistant in Mathematics at [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr) (Engineering School attached to University of Montpellier).

Research interests
======
My work is focused on theoretical and numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), and their applications to physics problems, mainly fluid mechanics.

- <b>Models</b>. Conservation laws, non-linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs, models coupling.
- <b>Numerics</b>. Discontinuous Galerkin & Finite-Volume schemes, well-balanced schemes, ALE approaches.
- <b>Applications</b>. Fluid mechanics, nonlinear Shallow-Water equations, dispersive PDEs.
- <b>Scientific computing</b>. Object oriented and generic programming, parallel computing.

Highlights
======
With [Benjamin Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/index.php?page=index) & [Tristan Xabada](https://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/fr/personnel?PERS=Tristan%20Xabada), we went to Lozère on October 12 and 13 to promote mathematics professions, talk about our thesis subject and our student path with high schoolers (collaboration with IREM - Institut de Recheche sur l'Enseignement des Mathématiques).
