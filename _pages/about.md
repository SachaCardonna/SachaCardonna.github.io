I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics, under the supervision of [François Vilar](https://francois-vilar.pagesperso-orange.fr) & [Fabien Marche](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~marche/) at [Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck](https://imag.umontpellier.fr) (IMAG - University of Montpellier).

My work is focused on theoretical and numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), and their applications to physics problems, mainly fluid mechanics.

Research interests
======
- Theoretical analysis of PDEs, Hyperbolic equations, Modeling & coupling;
- Numerical analysis of PDEs, Discontinuous Galerkin schemes, Finite-Volume schemes, ALE approaches;
- Fluid mechanics, Nonlinear Shallow-Water equations;
- Scientific computing, parallel computing.
