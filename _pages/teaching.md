<b> HA8401H </b> - <b> Preparatory cycle mathematics </b>(2nd year B.Sc.) <br>
<i> Engineering school Polytech Montpellier</i> 

<i> Description. </i> The preparatory cycle at Polytech Montpellier is tailored to prepare students for the pursuit of an engineering degree within any specialized field available in France. Mathematics courses are intentionally designed to be both comprehensive and profound, with a particular focus on students who aspire to explore theoretical domains such as mathematical engineering, physics, and mechanics. These courses consistently encompass both analytical and algebraic chapters, guaranteeing that students acquire a robust and well-rounded mathematical foundation to serve them effectively in their forthcoming engineering endeavors. 

<i> Topics. </i> Differential calculus, topology, bilinear algebra, probability.

<b> XADES4 </b> - <b> Supervised mathematical assignments </b>(2nd year B.Sc.) <br>
<i> Engineering school Polytech Montpellier</i> 

<i> Description. </i> Supervised assignments is a specific system for students following the preparatory cycle in Polytech Montpellier, allowing them to assimilate the educational content provided by developing their autonomy and their capacity for self-assessment. 
Each week, students are placed in exam conditions with a subject to be covered in two hours. Teachers are there to guide them, help them overcome their difficulties and possibly become aware of their shortcomings. 
These homework are training in scientific and technical production, here in mathematics.

<b> MathC2+ program - Mathematics and Modeling </b> (04/24, IRES/IMAG, Montpellier) <br>
<i> supervision of high school students volunteers </i> 

<i> Description. </i> During the MathC2+ internship with me, the first day focuses on introducing applied mathematics and myself, followed by a hands-on activity measuring the free fall times of objects of varying weights from different heights, and a lesson on integration and point kinematics to derive the motion equation as a second-degree polynomial. The second day delves into numerical resolution methods, including bisection, Newton, and secant methods, highlighting their significance in physics and engineering. This is complemented by constructing mini catapults in groups to explore physical principles for optimization, linking these to motion equations discussed on day one. The final day introduces Python programming, where participants will create small programs to familiarize themselves with coding and algorithmic thinking. The culmination of the internship involves developing a code that both theoretically and numerically solves the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, serving as the capstone project.

<b> Introduction to Applied Mathematics </b> (12/23, IRES/IMAG, Montpellier) <br>
<i> Supervision of 9th grade trainees </i> 

<i> Description. </i> We demonstrate how mathematical equations can describe real-world physical problems, using the example of two trains traveling towards each other to illustrate the application of mathematics in understanding motion and distance. It involves calculating when the trains will meet to avoid collision, using both theoretical and numerical approaches. The theoretical part deals with the mathematical formulation of the problem, including equations for distance, speed, and time. The numerical part introduces the bisection method for finding approximate solutions to equations, which are too complex for analytical solutions.
We then discuss about implementing our methods, covering basic programming concepts and demonstrating how to use the bisection method in code. This highlights the importance of mathematics in real-world problem-solving and the role of programming in modern mathematics.

<b> Fête de la Science </b> (12-13/10, Peytavin & Saint-Paul high schools, Mende & Langogne) <br>
<i> With [Benjamin Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier/index.php?page=index) & [Tristan Xabada](https://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/fr/personnel?PERS=Tristan%20Xabada)</i> 

<i> Description. </i> We went to Lozère on October 12 and 13 to promote mathematics professions, talk about our thesis subject and our student path with high schoolers (collaboration with IREM - Institut de Recherche sur l'Enseignement des Mathématiques). Benjamin Charlier is a mathematician working at [IMAG](https://imag.umontpellier.fr), in the Probability & Statistics team. Tristan Xabada is a Ph.D. student in Biophysics, working at [L2C](https://coulomb.umontpellier.fr) & [CBS](https://www.cbs.cnrs.fr/index.php/fr/).
