<h2 style="text-align:center;">2nd year B.Sc.</h2>

<p><b> HA8401H </b> - <b> Differential calculus & multivariable integration </b><br>
<i> Engineering school Polytech Montpellier </i> <br><br>
The preparatory cycle at Polytech Montpellier is tailored to prepare students for the pursuit of an engineering degree within any specialized field available in France. Mathematics courses are intentionally designed to be both comprehensive and profound, with a particular focus on students who aspire to explore theoretical domains such as mathematical engineering, physics, and mechanics. These courses consistently encompass both analytical and algebraic chapters, guaranteeing that students acquire a robust and well-rounded mathematical foundation to serve them effectively in their forthcoming engineering endeavors. <br><br>

<p><b> XADES4 </b> - <b> Supervised mathematical assignments </b><br>
<i> Engineering school Polytech Montpellier </i> <br><br>
Supervised assignments is a specific system for students following the preparatory cycle in Polytech Montpellier, allowing them to assimilate the educational content provided by developing their autonomy and their capacity for self-assessment.  
Each week, students are placed in exam conditions with a subject to be covered in two hours. Teachers are there to guide them, help them overcome their difficulties and possibly become aware of their shortcomings. This course is directly related to HA8401H. <br><br>
