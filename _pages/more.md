## Personal and professional commitments
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">

Outside of my academic work, I try to stay engaged in causes I consider important, both within and beyond the university. These include access to education, social volunteering, scientific integrity... This section outlines a few personal principles and activities that have shaped how I approach research, teaching, and everyday life.

<details>
<summary><strong>Access to education</strong></summary>
I am committed to helping bridge the gap in access to higher education, particularly for students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. Since 2024, I have for example supervised several MathC2 workshops, national programs in France aimed at high school students from under-resourced schools and often with a strong focus on encouraging young women to pursue scientific studies. 

I have also participated in multiple high school outreach events where I presented my work and the broader world of applied mathematics in concrete and relatable terms. In my own teaching at the university, I make it a priority to build strong, individualized connections with students. I meet with many of them one-on-one to ensure they feel supported, especially those who may lack familiarity with the expectations and codes of academic environments, as I did in the past.  

I am deeply convinced that social class remains the most structural and persistent form of inequality in access to academic and scientific careers. I intend to continue working closely with highly motivated students whose families are not traditionally connected to the world of higher education or research.  

Beyond outreach, I aim to develop my own accessible teaching resources; in particular, content designed to demystify mathematics and scientific studies for students who may lack early exposure or institutional support. My long-term goal is to help make our field more welcoming and comprehensible to those who are often kept at its margins. But as I am still a student, this can wait. ☺

<summary><strong>Volunteering</strong></summary>
I have always believed in giving back to society, in return for the many opportunities and support it has offered me. For several years, I regularly organized activities and animations for children in the pediatric ward of the hospital in my hometown. I also gave free tutoring sessions to classmates or younger students who needed academic support, and when I was younger I volunteered at the local community center (MJC) of my hometown. In addition, I have occasionally acted as a foster home for pets in need (I love animals).

<summary><strong>Scientific integrity</strong></summary>
As a PhD student just beginning my career, I don’t have all the answers, but one thing I care deeply about is the integrity of the work I contribute to.  

From the very start of my thesis, my advisors have emphasized the importance of rigorous, meaningful, and honest research. I try to uphold that standard by asking myself whether what I'm doing really brings something new.  

I’m well aware that the pressure to publish is real, but I don’t want to fall into the habit of producing papers just to build up a list. I'd rather take my time, collaborate thoughtfully, and produce results I can stand by, even if that means fewer publications for now.

<summary><strong>Blood and plasma donation</strong></summary>
I am a regular blood and plasma donor. I started donating at a young age and continue to do so whenever possible. I am particularly aware of the importance of donations for people with rare blood types. I encourage anyone who is eligible to donate and help address ongoing shortages. You can easily make an appointment through the <a href="https://dondesang.efs.sante.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFS</a> website.

## Some recommendations about films, music, and books
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
I have always been passionate about literature, cinema, and music. These arts have had a significant impact on my life and have shaped the way I see and think about the world.

### Films
Here is a selection of four of my favorite movies, which I recommend depending on the mood you are in. These four films are quite sad, but they all share the same thing: a message of hope.

### Music
I spend most of my days with music playing in the background. Since my music tastes are quite eclectic, recommending music is not easy for me: I chose here four albums, each  in a different musical style.
