Personal interests and values within and beyond my academic work.

## Personal and professional commitments
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">

Outside of my academic work, I try to stay engaged in causes I consider important, both within and beyond the university. These include access to education, social volunteering, scientific integrity... I do not share them to give lessons or to present myself as a model. Actually it's quite the opposite, I see them more as areas where I still have a lot to learn. I am always open to discussion, constructive criticism, and new perspectives that can help me improve.

<summary><strong>Access to education</strong></summary>
I am committed to helping bridge the gap in access to higher education, particularly for students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. I have for example supervised several MathC2 workshops, national programs in France aimed at high school students from under-resourced schools and often with a strong focus on encouraging young women to pursue scientific studies.  
I have also participated in multiple outreach events where I presented my work and the broader world of applied mathematics. In my own teaching at the university, I make it a priority to build strong, individualized connections with students, ensure they feel supported, especially those who may lack familiarity with the expectations and codes of academic environments, as I did in the past.   
I am deeply convinced that social class remains the most structural and persistent form of inequality in access to academic and scientific careers.  
Beyond outreach, I aim to develop my own accessible teaching resources; in particular, content designed to demystify mathematics and scientific studies for students who may lack early exposure or institutional support. My long-term goal is to help make our field more welcoming and comprehensible to those who are often kept at its margins. But as I am still a student, this can wait...

<summary><strong>Volunteering missions</strong></summary>
I have always believed in giving back to society, in return for the many opportunities and support it has offered me. For several years, I regularly organized activities and animations for children in the pediatric ward of the hospital in my hometown. I also gave free tutoring sessions to classmates or younger students who needed academic support, and when I was younger I volunteered at the local community center (MJC) of my hometown. In addition, I have occasionally acted as a foster home for pets in need (I love animals).

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;"></div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scientific integrity</strong></summary>
As a PhD student just beginning my career, one thing I care deeply about is the integrity of the work I contribute to.  
From the very start of my thesis, my advisors have emphasized the importance of rigorous, meaningful, and honest research. I try to uphold that standard by asking myself whether what I'm doing really brings something new.  
I’m well aware that the pressure to publish is real, but I don’t want to fall into the habit of producing papers just to build up a list. I'd rather take my time, collaborate thoughtfully, and produce results I can stand by, even if that means fewer publications in my career.

</details>

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;"></div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Local craftsmanship and agriculture</strong></summary>
I believe the quality of what we use and enjoy is closely connected to the people who create it. Whenever possible, I choose to support local artisans, small producers, and independent businesses.  
That can mean buying food directly from nearby farms, choosing handmade objects from craftspeople I know, while recommending their work to friends and colleagues.  
It is not about rejecting mass production altogether, but more about helping keep alive the skills, creativity, and human connections that often disappear in industrial processes.

</details>

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;"></div>

<details>
<summary><strong>Blood and plasma donation</strong></summary>
I am a regular blood and plasma donor. I started donating at 18 and continue to do so whenever possible. I am particularly aware of the importance of donations for people with rare blood types. I encourage anyone who is eligible to donate and help address ongoing shortages. You can easily make an appointment through the <a href="https://dondesang.efs.sante.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFS</a> website.

## Some film, music, and book picks
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
I have always been passionate about literature, cinema, and music. These arts have had a significant impact on my life and have shaped the way I see and think about the world.

### Films
I have been a movie lover since I was young, and I enjoy recommending films that have stayed with me over the years. Here is a selection of six of my favorite works; while they are all kinda melancholic, each carries, in its own way, some hope.

### Music
I spend most of my days with music playing in the background. Since my music tastes are quite eclectic, recommending music is not easy for me; I tried to pick here six albums, each in a different musical style.

### Literature
When I was younger, I used to read a lot. With my PhD, I do not have as much time for it anymore, and I miss it... Still, I have a strong passion for literature, and here's six works that have had a significant impact on my life.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">

    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        Having a healthy body is one of the greatest gifts we can receive in life. It is easy to forget it when everything seems fine, but good health is something to be valued and enjoyed every day.

  <div class="advice-card" tabindex="0">
    <div class="advice-title">Staying humble</div>
    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        At university and in research, it is easy to feel pressure to prove yourself. I learned that staying humble helps you progress more steadily. There will always be people who know more than you, and that is normal. Asking questions and accepting mistakes is not a weakness, it is how you grow. I wish first-year PhD Sacha had known this better!

  <div class="advice-card" tabindex="0">
    <div class="advice-title">Studying regularly</div>
    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        I believe that regular work is much more effective than last-minute efforts. Even small but consistent study sessions add up over time. It also reduces stress before exams and helps you build long-term understanding instead of short-term memorization. I have to admit that the few times I tried last-minute cramming as a student, the results were never very satisfying...

  <div class="advice-card" tabindex="0">
  <div class="advice-title">Choosing your own path</div>
  <div class="advice-overlay">
    <div>
      Do not feel forced to follow the road your parents, teachers, or society expect from you. There is so-called "royal paths". Try, make mistakes, and start again if needed. The real goal is to find a job that makes you want to wake up in the morning with energy and good mood.

<div class="advice-card" tabindex="0">
  <div class="advice-title">Trusting the process</div>
  <div class="advice-overlay">

      Progress is often slow and invisible day by day. It is frustrating as hell, but consistency always pays off. What looks like small steps now will add up over months and years. Trust the process, even when results are not immediate.

    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        I know from experience how difficult it can be to study while also working on the side, but sometimes there is no other choice and it is important to acknowledge it. Still, I would encourage anyone in this situation not to lose sight of the long-term goal: the job or career that your studies can open for you. Try to protect your studies as much as possible.

    <div class="advice-title">Keeping balance</div>
    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        One of my PhD advisors recently reminded me of this: studying hard is important, but so is rest and hobbies. I noticed that when I keep time for sport, reading, or seeing friends, I come back to work with more energy and focus. Academic success is easier to sustain when life feels balanced.

  <div class="advice-card" tabindex="0">
  <div class="advice-title">Starting simple</div>
  <div class="advice-overlay">
    <div>
      When I work on something new, I always try to start simple. A small working version of a model or a code is much easier to test, to understand, and to correct; once the basics are solid, I gradually add complexity step by step. Also, writing a short script often shows where the equations are not as clear as I thought, while the maths helps explain what the computer output cannot.

  <div class="advice-title">Learning and practicing</div>
  <div class="advice-overlay">
    <div>
      In maths especially, nothing replaces knowing your course well. But theory alone is not enough: solving exercises again and again is what makes the concepts stick and gives you the reflexes to apply them. Also, avoid relying too much on exercises with full solutions. The temptation to look at the answer too soon is strong, and you will learn less.

    <div class="advice-title">Being cautious with heavy lifting</div>
    <div class="advice-overlay">
      <div>
        Powerlifting and very heavy weight training taught me discipline, but also humility. At one point, I injured my back because I pushed too far. Strength training can be great, but progress should not come at the cost of health. Good technique, patience, and listening to your body are essential.

  <div class="advice-title">Finding a good diet</div>
  <div class="advice-overlay">
    <div>
      I recommend finding an eating pattern that feels sustainable, supports your energy and training, and fits your daily life (because "we are what we eat", right?). For example, I have practiced intermittent fasting for few years. It worked for me, but it is not a universal solution. If a diet creates anxiety around food, rigid rules, or loss of control, that is a warning sign. Do not hesitate to speak with a qualified professional if needed.

## Reflections on video games
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">

<p>
Video games often get a bad reputation. People say they are just a waste of time, or even that they make players violent. I do not agree. Any form of fiction can have a bad influence if it is taken the wrong way, whether it is a movie, a book, or a song. But that does not mean the whole medium should be judged like that.
</p>

<p>
For me, video games are a real form of art. They bring together story, images, music, and something more: interactivity. You do not just watch a story, you play it, you take part in it. That makes the experience very personal. I also feel that many games today show more creativity and courage in their writing than what you often see in mainstream cinema.  
Two games in particular have stayed with me: the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> saga and <em>Outer Wilds</em>.
</p>

<style>
  .game-section { margin: 2em 0; }

  .game-section::after { content: ""; display: table; clear: both; }

<div class="game-section">
  <img class="game-img right" src="/images/games/mgs.jpg" alt="Metal Gear Solid">
  <h3>Metal Gear Solid - Konami (1998–2015)</h3>
<p>
At first sight, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> looks like a series of stealth or war games. But deep down, it is an anti-militarist (even anarchist) story.  
It makes you think about the meaning of war, about where technology can lead when it goes too far, and even about artificial intelligence, years before it became a common topic.  
What makes it special for me is its mix of cinematic quality and the way it often breaks the fourth wall. The game speaks directly to you, not just to your character.  
Sometimes the story feels confusing or too much, but that is also what makes it strong. It does not try to be simple entertainment. It stays in your head because it asks questions that still matter today.  
For me, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> was clear proof that video games can be real works of art, with strong philosophical and political ideas.

      “Life isn't just about passing on your genes. We can leave behind much more than just DNA. Through speech, music, literature and movies... what we've seen, heard, felt... anger, joy and sorrow... these are the things I will pass on. That's what I live for. We need to pass the torch, and let our children read our messy and sad history by its light. We have all the magic of the digital age to do that with. The human race will probably come to an end some time, and new species may rule over this planet. Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of life we can. Building the future and keeping the past alive are one in the same thing.”<br>

<div class="game-section">
  <img class="game-img left" src="/images/games/outerwilds.jpeg" alt="Outer Wilds">
  <h3>Outer Wilds - Möbius Interactive (2019)</h3>
<p>
<em>Outer Wilds</em> is very different. There is no combat, no scores, no missions to follow. It is only exploration: a small solar system to visit, secrets to find, and a limited time to do it before everything starts again.  
What touched me the most was the atmosphere: sad and bright at the same time. The game makes you face the idea that everything ends, that you cannot reach every goal, and that curiosity itself gives value to the journey.  
There are no tutorials, no guides. You just try, fail, and try again. It is about curiosity, learning on your own, and the small wonder of each discovery.  
<em>Outer Wilds</em> is not always easy. Sometimes it feels heavy, even a bit depressing. But it is also one of the rare games that left me with real questions and a strange feeling, close to what I get with a novel or a play.  
It makes you think about time, knowledge, and mostly our place in the universe.
