## Personal and professional commitments
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">

Outside of my academic work, I try to stay engaged in causes I consider important, both within and beyond the university. These include access to education, social volunteering, scientific integrity... I do not share them to give lessons or to present myself as a model. Actually it's quite the opposite, I see them more as areas where I still have a lot to learn. I am always open to discussion, constructive criticism, and new perspectives that can help me improve.

<summary><strong>Access to education</strong></summary>
I am committed to helping bridge the gap in access to higher education, particularly for students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. I have for example supervised several MathC2 workshops, national programs in France aimed at high school students from under-resourced schools and often with a strong focus on encouraging young women to pursue scientific studies.  
I have also participated in multiple outreach events where I presented my work and the broader world of applied mathematics. In my own teaching at the university, I make it a priority to build strong, individualized connections with students, ensure they feel supported, especially those who may lack familiarity with the expectations and codes of academic environments, as I did in the past.   
I am deeply convinced that social class remains the most structural and persistent form of inequality in access to academic and scientific careers.  
Beyond outreach, I aim to develop my own accessible teaching resources; in particular, content designed to demystify mathematics and scientific studies for students who may lack early exposure or institutional support. My long-term goal is to help make our field more welcoming and comprehensible to those who are often kept at its margins. But as I am still a student, this can wait...

<summary><strong>Volunteering</strong></summary>
I have always believed in giving back to society, in return for the many opportunities and support it has offered me. For several years, I regularly organized activities and animations for children in the pediatric ward of the hospital in my hometown. I also gave free tutoring sessions to classmates or younger students who needed academic support, and when I was younger I volunteered at the local community center (MJC) of my hometown. In addition, I have occasionally acted as a foster home for pets in need (I love animals).

<details>
<summary><strong>Scientific integrity</strong></summary>
As a PhD student just beginning my career, one thing I care deeply about is the integrity of the work I contribute to.  
From the very start of my thesis, my advisors have emphasized the importance of rigorous, meaningful, and honest research. I try to uphold that standard by asking myself whether what I'm doing really brings something new.  
I’m well aware that the pressure to publish is real, but I don’t want to fall into the habit of producing papers just to build up a list. I'd rather take my time, collaborate thoughtfully, and produce results I can stand by, even if that means fewer publications in my career.

<details>
<summary><strong>Local craftsmanship and agriculture</strong></summary>
I believe the quality of what we use and enjoy is closely connected to the people who create it. Whenever possible, I choose to support local artisans, small producers, and independent businesses.  
That can mean buying food directly from nearby farms, choosing handmade objects from craftspeople I know, while recommending their work to friends and colleagues.  
It is not about rejecting mass production altogether, but more about helping keep alive the skills, creativity, and human connections that often disappear in industrial processes.

<summary><strong>Blood and plasma donation</strong></summary>
I am a regular blood and plasma donor. I started donating at a young age and continue to do so whenever possible. I am particularly aware of the importance of donations for people with rare blood types. I encourage anyone who is eligible to donate and help address ongoing shortages. You can easily make an appointment through the <a href="https://dondesang.efs.sante.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFS</a> website.

## Some film, music, and book picks
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
I have always been passionate about literature, cinema, and music. These arts have had a significant impact on my life and have shaped the way I see and think about the world.

### Films
I have been a movie lover since I was young, and I enjoy recommending films that have stayed with me over the years. Here is a selection of five of my favorite works; while they are all on the melancholic side, each carries, in its own way, some hope.

### Music
I spend most of my days with music playing in the background. Since my music tastes are quite eclectic, recommending music is not easy for me; I chose here five albums, each in a different musical style.

### Literature
When I was younger, I used to read a lot. With my PhD, I do not have as much time for it anymore, and I miss it... Still, I have a strong passion for literature, and I have selected five works that have had a significant impact on my life.
