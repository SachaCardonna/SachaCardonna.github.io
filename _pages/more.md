## Personal and professional commitments
<hr style="margin-top: -0.1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
I strongly believe in fair access to education and in the role that scientists can play in breaking down social barriers.

- **Access to education**: I am committed to helping bridge the gap in access to higher education, particularly for students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds. Since 2024, I have for example supervised several *MathC2+* workshops, national programs in France aimed at high school students from under-resourced schools (*zones d'éducation prioritaire*) and often with a strong focus on encouraging young women to pursue scientific studies. These internships not only introduce participants to advanced mathematics in an accessible and engaging way, but also aim to foster self-confidence and ambition.

I have also participated in multiple high school outreach events where I presented my work and the broader world of applied mathematics in concrete and relatable terms. In my own teaching at the university, I make it a priority to build strong, individualized connections with students. I meet with many of them one-on-one to ensure they feel supported (especially those who may lack familiarity with the expectations and codes of academic environments, as I did by the past).

I am deeply convinced that social class remains the most structural and persistent form of inequality in access to academic and scientific careers. I intend to continue working closely with highly motivated students whose families are not traditionally connected to the world of higher education or research. Beyond outreach, I aim to develop my own accessible teaching resources; in particular, content designed to demystify mathematics and scientific studies for students who may lack early exposure or institutional support. My long-term goal is to help make our field more welcoming and comprehensible to those who are often kept at its margins. But as I am still a student, this can wait. <span style=\"font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;\">☺</span>
  
- **Volunteering**: For several years, I regularly organized activities and animations for children in the pediatric ward of the hospital in my hometown. I also gave free tutoring sessions to classmates or younger students who needed academic support, and I volunteered at the local community center (MJC) in my hometown. I have always believed in giving back to society, in return for the many opportunities and support it has offered me. 

- **Scientific integrity**: My PhD advisors have instilled in me the importance of rigorous and meaningful research. I aim to ensure that each paper I co-author brings genuine new contributions. I distance myself from overpublishing and value quality over quantity.

- **Blood and plasma donation**: I’m a regular donor and advocate for blood and plasma donation, especially crucial for those with rare blood types.
