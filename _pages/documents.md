1. Finite-Volume Subcells correction on discontinuous Galerkin schemes.
Abstract: Building and implementing a new strategy for stabilizing discontinuous Galerkin numerical methods using a Finite-Volume subcells type approach for the Nonlinear Shallow-Water equations. We consider here an a priori approach, more precisely a monolithic subcell dG/FV convex property preserving scheme. Advised by Fran√ßois Vilar & Fabien Marche.
