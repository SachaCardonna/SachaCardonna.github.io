=======

During the early stages of my internship with F. Vilar and F. Marche, I embarked on the development of a small C++ code focused on addressing Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for 1D conservation laws. 

It is important to note that the code is a work in progress, far from being complete or flawless. Its creation was driven by my commitment to simplicity and understandability. I strived to ensure that the code's structure and implementation were as straightforward as possible, enabling users to grasp the underlying concepts with ease.

Looking ahead, my aspiration is to further enhance and refine the code. By expanding its functionality and making it more comprehensive, I aim to create a valuable resource for students seeking a simplified example of DG schemes. This endeavor stems from my own experiences as a student, where access to such a resource would have greatly facilitated my understanding and learning process.
