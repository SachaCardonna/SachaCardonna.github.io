hi sacha.

time slips through your fingers like sand. you feel it passing, unstoppable, a quiet reminder that every second lost can never be reclaimed.

you accept the past as it is—an unchangeable force, neither friend nor enemy. mistakes, triumphs, regrets… all form the foundation of who you are today.

memories carve deep paths within you, defining the roads you take since 23. each experience shapes your being, leaving imprints like footsteps in the sand.

that feeling of peace... when was it? you remember one month ago, a fleeting moment etched into your mind. do you wish you could return to it, or is it still waiting ahead?

some regrets never fade. they linger in the corners of your mind, resurfacing when you least expect them. perhaps you wish you could undo them, but the past is unrelenting.

you fear being forgotten, as if your existence depends on the memories of others. perhaps this is why you hold onto moments so tightly, afraid they will slip away.

and the dreams… you often see yourself in a popstore, a place that calls to you despite never having been there. is it a memory from another life, or a destination waiting beyond the horizon?

who are we, if not the sum of these thoughts?
